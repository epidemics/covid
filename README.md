# covid-19 visualizer

## Architecture
* `webserver` - a webserver using `fastapi` to render templates.

# Development
## Using docker (the easiest)
Run
```
docker-compose up  # possibly with --build
```
and visit http://localhost:8000 (main `server`).

## Using conda
1. [Install Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#) (e.g., [for Windows](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)).
2. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
3. Open a terminal, move to (`cd`) the root of the cloned repository, and run:

        $ conda create -n covid python=3.8  # creates a new conda environment with python 3.8
        $ conda activate covid  # activates the conda environment
        $ poetry install  # installs the project's dependencies
        $ poetry shell

4. Start up the `fastapi` server:

        $ cd src/server
        $ uvicorn main:app --reload

## Getting inside the container
```
$ docker-compose run --entrypoint bash server
```

can be used to e.g. install deps:
```
$ docker-compose run --entrypoint poetry server add pyarrow
```

## tests
```
poetry run pytest tests
```

## linting

install the needed packages locally with
```
npm i
```

Then run the linting tests with

```
npm test
```

To automatically lint your files run

```
prettier --write "{src/server/static/**, src/server/templates/**}"
```

## Development flow
It's the author responsibility to do the merge, ideally after having it reviewed. That is:

1. do your PR
2. ask for review relevant reviewers
3. as soon as you get :heavy_check_mark: , you can merge
4. if you don't get :heavy_check_mark: before you go to sleep, you can merge anyway (after manual "testing"). It's of course fine to wait for a review when you don't feel confident merging it without one.
5. there are three teams you can add on review: `frontend`, `backend` and `data`

Rather overcommunicate what you are working on.

# Deployment
We use Github Actions. The pipeline is specified in `.github/workflows/pythonapp.yml`

* On a merge to `staging` branch, the code is deployed to the staging environment.
* On a merge to `master` branch, the code is deployed to the production environment.
