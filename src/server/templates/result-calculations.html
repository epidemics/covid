      Around the time of your event in Germany, there will probably be

    This means your event will probably infect

    to

  <label>
    They will probably go on to infect

    If 100 event organisers like yourself canceled events, we'd avoid
    <span class="min-avoided"></span>
    to
    <span class="max-avoided"></span>
    new infections.
  </label>

  <label>
    This would smoothen the peak pandemic by x%, which means
    <span class="min-medical-care"></span>
    to
    <span class="max-medical-care"></span>
    more people would be able to get adequate medical care.

  <label>Overall, we'd recommend</label>

  <button class="orange">Uncertain</button>
  <button class="red highlighted">Cancel</button>

    Your event poses a high risk, and by cnacelling you can meaningfully
    contribute to prevent further spread of covid-19

  <label>
    According to our models, it would be fine to host the event in
    <span class="proposed-month"></span>
    instead.
