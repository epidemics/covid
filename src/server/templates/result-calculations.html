      Around the time of your event in Germany, there will probably be
      <span class="min-cases"></span>
      to
      <span class="max-cases"></span>
      cases

  <label>
    This means your event will probably infect
    <span class="min-infect"></span>
    to
    <span class="max-infect"></span>
  </label>
  <button>See calculation v</button>

  <label>
    They will probably go on to infect
    <span class="min-infect-2nd-order"></span>
    to
    <span class="max-infect-2nd-order"></span>
    people

  <label>But a big uncertainty is how people will respond</label>
  <!-- TODO: add something that visualises the agency people have under different preparation measures -->

  <label>
    If 100 event organisers like yourself canceled events, we'd avoid
    <span class="min-avoided"></span>
    to
    <span class="max-avoided"></span>
    new infections.
  </label>

  <label>
    This would smoothen the peak pandemic by x%, which means
    <span class="min-medical-care"></span>
    to
    <span class="max-medical-care"></span>
    more people would be able to get adequate medical care.

  <label>Overall, we'd recommend</label>
  <button class="green">Go ahead</button>
  <button class="orange">Uncertain</button>
  <button class="red highlighted">Cancel</button>
  <p>
    Your event poses a high risk, and by cnacelling you can meaningfully
    contribute to prevent further spread of covid-19
  </p>

  <label>
    According to our models, it would be fine to host the event in
    <span class="proposed-month"></span>
    instead.
