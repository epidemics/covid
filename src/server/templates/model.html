        Under this scenario, we estimate:
        <ul>
          <li>The maximum number of simultaneously infected people will be <span id="sim-infected"></span></li>
          <li>The total number of people infected will be <span id="total-infected"></span></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact on <span class="selected-region"></span> is simulated using an epidemiological model based on
        global, real-world data on human population and travel patterns, displayed as an <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_curve">an epidemic curve</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to emphasise that real outcomes depend on human actions. The mitigation strength is our choice. Even
        given some mitigation level, the outcome is still uncertain, and depends on:
        <ul>
          <li>
            the seasonality of the virus and its response to changing weather conditions
          </li>
          <li>
            the mitigation decisions made by <i>other countries</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            technological progress in testing, contact tracing and vaccines
          </li>

        </ul>
        For now we are capturing the international response in a single parameter determining the rate of spread of
        SARS-CoV-2, but we are building <a

          containment and mitigation efforts</a> and working to integrate them into the model.

      <h5>How the model works</h5>
      <p><strong> Human forecasting</strong></p>
      <p>
        We are trying to augment data on confirmed cases by estimating the true
        number of infections in selected countries. This gets around issues of
        testing capacity and under-reporting in official statistics. This is
        done using a combination of statistical modelling and human forecasting.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Computational modelling</strong></p>
      <p>
        The results are used as an input to advanced epidemic modelling
        software, called
        <a href="http://www.gleamviz.org/" target="_blank">GLEaM</a>,
        running on high-performance computers.
      </p>
      <p>The global development of COVID-19 is simulated using:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          an airline booking dataset covering 3,800 commercial airports in about
          230 countries
        </li>
        <li>
          a commuting database covering over five million commuting connections
          within 40 countries
        </li>
        <li>multiple levels of global mitigation measures (currently captured as changes in the β of our model) </li>
        <li>
          multiple models of SARS-CoV-2, capturing uncertainty about seasonality
          and transmissibility
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The results are displayed as a pack of trajectories, representing the
        uncertainty inherent in our model — and the difference in trajectory
        caused by the response of us as a society.
      </p>
      <p><strong> Database of containment measures</strong></p>
      <p>
        We are tracking the effectiveness of containments measures in a
        <a href="http://epidemicforecasting.org/containment"
          target="_blank">public
          database</a>
        with hundreds of entries. As more data becomes available on their
        effectiveness we will integrate them into the simulation.
