        <h5 class="mitigation-strength-heading">How the Model Works</h5>
        <p>
          The impact on <span class="selected-region"></span> is simulated using an epidemiological model based on
          global, real-world data on human population and travel patterns, displayed as an <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_curve">an epidemic curve</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to emphasise that real outcomes depend on human actions. The mitigation strength is our choice. Even
          given some mitigation level, the outcome is still uncertain, and depends on:
          <ul>
            <li>
              the seasonality of the virus and its response to changing weather conditions
            </li>
            <li>
              the mitigation decisions made by <i>other countries</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              technological progress in testing, contact tracing and vaccines
            </li>

          </ul>
          For now we are capturing the international response in a single parameter determining the rate of spread of
          SARS-CoV-2, but we are building <a
            href="https://www.notion.so/977d5e5be0434bf996704ec361ad621d?v=aa8e0c75520a479ea48f56cb4c289b7e">a database
            of
            containment and mitigation efforts</a> and working to integrate them into the model.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <p id="case-count-explanation"><strong> Active Infections Estimate </strong></p>
        <p>
          This counts number of people currently infected with COVID-19 (including those have not yet shown symptoms or
          are not yet infectious, but excluding those who have recovered or died).
        </p>
        <p>
          We are trying to augment data on confirmed cases by estimating the true
          number of infections in selected regions. This gets around issues of
          testing capacity and under-reporting in official statistics. This is
          done using a combination of statistical modelling and human forecasting.
        </p>
        <p id="mitigation-measures-explanation"><strong> Mitigation Measures </strong></p>
        <p>
          We're modelling mitigation measures via their impact on effective transmission rate, since the same mitigation
          strength can be often achieved in multiple ways. For example, something roughly in the range of "weak
          mitigation" can be achieved either by closing schools and banning large gatherings (alone) or by compulsory
          wear of masks and widely adopted voluntary social distancing (alone).
        </p>
        <p>
          The available mitigation levels are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do nothing
          </li>
          <li>
            Decrease of effective transmission rate by 20%
          </li>
          <li>
            Decrease of effective transmission rate by 50%
          </li>
          <li>
            Decrease of effective transmission rate by 80%
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For comparison, in Wuhan the estimated reproduction number was ~3.5 before mitigation measures, and ~0.32
          after implementation of all measures. This would correspond to a mitigation strength of ~90% — stronger than
          our "Strong" setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are tracking the effectiveness of containments measures in a
          <a href="http://epidemicforecasting.org/containment" target="_blank">public
            database</a>
          with thousands of entries. As more data becomes available on their
          effectiveness we will integrate them into the simulation.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Computational modelling</strong></p>
        <p>
          The results are used as an input to advanced epidemic modelling
          software, called
          <a href="http://www.gleamviz.org/" target="_blank">GLEaM</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The global development of COVID-19 is simulated using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a global transport network covering 230 countries (with multiple settings of travel reduction), based on the
            <a href="https://www.oag.com/" target="_blank">Official Airline Guide database</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            commuting connections within 40
            countries
          </li>
          <li>
            multiple models of SARS-CoV-2, capturing uncertainty about seasonality
            and transmissibility
          </li>
          <li>multiple levels of global mitigation measures, represented by their effect on reproduction rate </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The results are displayed as a pack of trajectories, representing the
          uncertainty inherent in our model — and the difference in trajectory
          caused by the response of us as a society.
