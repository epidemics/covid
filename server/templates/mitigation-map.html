        This map is displaying our crude estimate of the effective reproduction number,
        based on growth data from the past week, assuming serial interval of 5 days.
        The number can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case of infection.
        Current values reflect all mitigation measures taken, and also the gradually decreasing fraction of naive population.
        The basic reproduction number without any mitigation in most countries is probably somewhere between 2 and 5.
        The basic interpretation is: with numbers bellow 1, the epidemic is shrinking.
        With numbers around and slightly above 1, the epidemic could be shrinking or growing, but slowly.
        With higher numbers the mitigation is insufficient to keep the epidemic under control,
        and with values above one the growth is rapid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to currently limited resources and data availability, we cannot make estimates for every country.
        If countries are coloured in black, this indicates that we have not estimated case numbers for this country.
        This does not mean that we have estimated the number of active cases to be zero cases.
