              This time-series is displaying our estimate of the effective reproduction number "Reff", based on growth data since the start of the epidemic. The number can be thought of as the expected number of infections directly generated by one additional infection. We estimate that the basic reproduction number (or "R") without any mitigation in most countries is likely somewhere between 2 and 5.
Current values reflect all mitigation measures taken, and also that the fraction of susceptible individuals in the population is gradually decreasing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The basic interpretation of this number is as follows
              <ul>
                <li>If R is below 1, the epidemic is shrinking.</li>
                <li>If R is around and slightly above 1, the epidemic could be either shrinking or growing, but slowly.</li>
                <li>If R is larger than 2 the the mitigation is insufficient to keep the epidemic under control, and the growth is rapid.</li>

          <p>
          The impact on <span class="selected-region">the selected region</span> is simulated using
          an epidemiological model based on global, real-world data on human
          population and travel patterns, displayed as an
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_curve"

        </p>
          <p>
          We want to emphasise that real outcomes depend on human actions. The
          mitigation strength is our choice. Even given some mitigation level,
          the outcome is still uncertain, and depends on:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            the seasonality of the virus and its response to changing weather
            conditions
          </li>
            <li>the mitigation decisions made by <i>other countries</i>
            </li>
            <li>
            technological progress in testing, contact tracing and vaccines
          </li>
          </ul>

          For now we are capturing the international response in a single
          parameter determining the rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2, but we are

            <strong> Active Infections Estimate </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          This counts number of people currently infected with COVID-19
          (including those have not yet shown symptoms or are not yet
          infectious, but excluding those who have recovered or died).
        </p>
          <p>
          We are trying to augment data on confirmed cases by estimating the
          true number of infections in selected regions. This gets around issues
          of testing capacity and under-reporting in official statistics. This
          is done using a combination of statistical modelling and human
          forecasting.

            <strong> Mitigation Measures </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          We're modelling mitigation measures via their impact on effective
          transmission rate, since the same mitigation strength can be often
          achieved in multiple ways. 
        {#For example, something roughly in the range
          of "weak mitigation" can be achieved either by closing schools and
          banning large gatherings (alone) or by compulsory wear of masks and
          widely adopted voluntary social distancing (alone).
        </p>

          <p>
          The available mitigation levels are:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            Do nothing
          </li>
            <li>
            Decrease of effective transmission rate by 20%
          </li>
            <li>
            Decrease of effective transmission rate by 50%
          </li>
            <li>
            Decrease of effective transmission rate by 80%
          </li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>
          For comparison, in Wuhan the estimated reproduction number was ~3.5
          before mitigation measures, and ~0.32 after implementation of all
          measures. This would correspond to a mitigation strength of ~90% —
          stronger than our "Strong" setting.
        </p>

          We are tracking the effectiveness of containments measures in a
          <a href="/containment">public database</a>
          with thousands of entries. As more data becomes available on their
          effectiveness we will integrate them into the simulation.

          (the authors of the software are not part of our project and have not

          <ul>

            reduction)
          </li>
            <li>
            multiple models of SARS-CoV-2, capturing uncertainty about

            multiple levels of global mitigation measures, represented by their

          The results are displayed as a pack of trajectories, representing the
          uncertainty inherent in our model — and the difference in trajectory
          caused by the response of us as a society.
